# Recipe
* Step One: First, I pull out one of my skillets and put the grated florets into it. Over low-medium heat, I let them cook (with just a hint of olive oil) for about ten minutes or so.

* Step Two: Once the florets are cooked, I remove them from the skillet and put them into a mixing bowl. Then I add the Parmesan cheese and eggs and I mixed everything together. I then move the bowl to the side for just a moment.

* Step Three: Now it’s time to pull out a tray (or pizza pan) and put some parchment paper on it (you’ll see why in just a sec). I knead the dough into the shape I want it to be in—a square, a rectangle, a circle. It all depends on how I feel at the time. The parchment paper is what will keep the dough from sticking to the pan.
